Introduction of Scripting
Scripting is the process of writing small programs called scripts that are used to automate tasks, control software, and perform repetitive operations efficiently.

Scripts are usually interpreted, meaning they are executed line by line without the need for compilation.
 

Difference Between Scripting and Programming
1️⃣ Definition
